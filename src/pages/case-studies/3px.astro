    <h1>Realtime Data — Third-Party Exchange Access</h1>

    <p><strong>Role:</strong>Principal Technical Product Manager (Platform & Ecosystem)</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        A leading programmatic advertising exchange identified a major gap in its curation business: third-party curators lacked pre-auction bidstream access, preventing them from scaling spend across the exchange. This limitation contributed to the loss of $2–3M in MRR from a strategic customer and blocked broader GTM expansion.
