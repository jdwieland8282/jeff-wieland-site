      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        A large, global supply-side advertising platform faced a recurring, multi-year scalability
        issue with domain and audience targeting. Existing solutions did not scale, increased
        auction latency, capped buyer spend, and directly impacted win rates.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Led a cross-functional tiger team, translating business constraints into platform-level
        technical requirements, defining success metrics, and driving alignment across senior
        engineering leadership.
      </p>
       <ul>
        <li>Acted as voice of the customer while translating business constraints into technical requirements</li>
        <li>Defined success metrics and latency thresholds</li>
        <li>Managed delivery across 4 engineering leads and 12 ICs</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Execution</h2>

          <li>Drove enablement, testing, rollout, and adoption across the exchange</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Launched after ~6 months of development</li>
            <li>Resolved a multi-year structural issue</li>
            <li>Enabled scalable domain and bundle targeting for curators</li>
            <li>Unlocked XX ARR and expanded use cases to audiences, segments, zip codes, and households</li>
            <li>Now powers targeting across multiple real-time transaction systems at massive scale</li>
          </ul>
