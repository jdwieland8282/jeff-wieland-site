      <h1>Flagship Case Studies</h1>
        <p>
          The following case studies are anonymized representations of large-scale platform and ecosystem work I have led. Company-specific details, internal system names, and proprietary GTM strategies have been intentionally abstracted for confidentiality. Where work was conducted in open-source or public standards bodies, those organizations are named explicitly.
