      <p>
        Senior Director–caliber Product Leader with 15+ years building ad servers, SSPs, identity, privacy, and curation platforms at massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a senior technical product leader with 18 years in AdTech, beginning in 2008 on Microsoft’s Atlas ad server and progressing to Director‑level scope at Magnite. I lead platforms that process over <strong>1 trillion ad requests per day</strong>, including mission‑critical systems operating at <strong>300,000+ QPS</strong>.

        My work spans product strategy, distributed systems, identity, privacy, and monetization. I operate at the intersection of engineering, revenue, partnerships, and industry standards—turning ecosystem‑level problems into scalable, durable platforms.

      <h1>How I Operate as a Principal Technical Producty Manager</h1>
      <h2>1. I start with company-scale problems, not features</h2>
      <p>I focus on problems that materially impact revenue, platform leverage, or long-term competitiveness. I look for multi-year structural constraints—latency ceilings, ecosystem misalignment, regulatory risk, or GTM bottlenecks—and frame them in a way that enables executive alignment and sustained investment.</p>

      <h2>2. I operate at the intersection of platform, GTM, and ecosystem</h2>
      <p>The most valuable product work in AdTech happens between organizations, not within a single team. I routinely work across engineering, sales, partnerships, legal, and external stakeholders to ensure platforms are technically sound, commercially viable, and adoptable at ecosystem scale.</p>

      <h2>3. I lead through influence and clarity</h2>
      <p>At Senior Director scope, progress depends less on authority and more on clarity. I invest heavily in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear problem framing and written narratives</li>
        <li>Explicit trade-offs and decision criteria</li>
        <li>Metrics that reflect both system health and business outcomes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This creates alignment across senior engineering leaders, GTM teams, and executives.</p>

      <h2>4. I treat scale, latency, and reliability as first-class product features</h2>
      <p>In real-time advertising systems, performance is the product. I partner deeply with engineering to understand system limits, define success thresholds, and ensure that growth does not compromise auction health, buyer outcomes, or publisher revenue.</p>

      <h2>5. I build platforms that outlive individual roadmaps</h2>
      <p>My goal is to leave behind durable platforms, not isolated launches. That means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing for extensibility and future use cases</li>
        <li>Avoiding customer-specific dead ends</li>
        <li>Ensuring ownership models that scale across teams and years</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. I represent the company externally when it matters</h2>
      <p>When appropriate, I engage directly in industry forums, standards bodies, and open-source communities. This builds trust, accelerates adoption, and ensures that platform strategy aligns with where the ecosystem is actually going.</p>
